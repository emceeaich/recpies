# Chipotle Sweet Potatoes

Serves 6 to 10

Based on a recipe I found a long time ago in the San Jose Mercury News.

This dish will have some heat, use less chipotles if you want it milder.

This dish is vegan, making it great for inclusive potluck meals.

This would go well with a yogurt sauce. 

## Ingredients

* 3 lbs of sweet potatoes
* 1 7 oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
* 1 12 oz can, coconut milk
* Salt
* Smoked paprika for garnish

## Directions

Peel sweet potatoes and boil until tender. Drain and let steam evaporate. 

Add half a can of coconut milk and the can of chipotles to the cup of an immersion blender. Blend together until smooth. 

Add mixure and the remaining coconut milk to the cooked sweet potatoes and mash together until mixture is uniform. 

Add salt to taste.

Scrape into a rectangular pan and smooth the top with a spatula. 

Sprinkle with smoked paprika. 

At this point you can cover the the dish and put it in the refrigerator if you were making it ahead.

Finish in a 400 F oven for 15 to 30 minutes (depending on if you are reheating it from the refrigerator) un-covered until a crust forms. Serve.
