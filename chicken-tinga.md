# Chicken Tinga

This is a from-the-pantry version of Chicken Tinga, using canned peppers. 

Be sparing with the amount of water you add since you will reduce the sauce once the chicken cooks. 

Makes 4 servings. 

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp cumin seed ground in a mortal and pestle
- 3-4 cloves garlic ground with a 1/4 teaspoon salt in a mortar and pestle
- 1 small to medium onion, diced
- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 7oz can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 4oz can chopped hot green chilis (Hatch or similar)
- 1 tsp chicken stock powder
- Juice of one half lemon
- Finely chopped cilantro

## Directions

In a dutch oven or deep, wide pot, saute diced onion in 2 tbsp of oil over medium heat until soft and starting to brown. 

Add the crushed garlic and cook until fragrant. 

Add ground cumin seed and let bloom (around 30 seconds.)

Add chipotle peppers and sauce with enough water to fill the can, the green chilis, and the chicken stock powder. Stir.

Add chicken and stir again, making sure there's sufficent liquid to almost cover the chicken.

Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer.

Reduce heat to low. Cover. Let cook for an hour. 

Remove cover and transfer chicken pieces to bowl. 

Raise heat to a vigourous boil and let sauce reduce to half or less. 

Shread chicken with forks.

Once liquid has reduced and thickened, stir back in shredded chicken. Add lemon juice and cilantro. Stir to combine. 

Serve with beans, guacamole, and other sides as well as plenty of tortilias. 

Meat can also be used for tacos or burritos. 

## Note

If you use bone-in thighs or leg quarters, increase the amount of chicken to 2.5 to 2.75 lbs to account for bones.

If you use bone-in reduce the amount of chicken stock powder you use, but add a quarter tsp of MSG.

You could substitute dried peppers for the chipotle if you rehydrate them in hot water after removing stems and seeds.

Substitute two finely chopped jalepeno or serrano peppers for the canned green chilis.
