# Cynthia’s Portuguese soup

* 3-4 ham hocks
* 2 large russet potatoes
* 1/2 head of cabbage
* 2 sticks of linguiça
* 1 29 oz can of kidney beans
* 3-4 bay leaves
* Kosher salt
* Coarsely ground black pepper
Parmesan cheese

I use a pressure cooker (I ❤️ my Instant Pot). It speeds things up a bit and makes it easy to debone the cooked ham hocks. 

In the pressure cooker, put the ham hocks in and cover with water. Cook at high pressure for 60 minutes then let the pressure release. Remove the ham hocks and carve the meat off the bones. Return the meat to the pressure cooker. 

Peel and cube the potatoes. Slice the linguiça in coins. Core the cabbage and slice in medium chunks. Put the potatoes, cabbage, and linguiça in the pressure cooker and add water to the max level. Add the bay leaves. Cook at high pressure for 30 minutes and then let the pressure release. 

Drain and rinse the kidney beans and add to the cooker. Simmer the beans in the cooker with the lid off for 15-20 minutes until they are heated through. This keeps the beans firmer than if you had cooked them under pressure. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Serve hot and top with Parmesan cheese. This makes enough for Emma and I to have seconds and leftovers for later.
