# Turkey lentil, bean, and barley soup

Making a soup with the turkey carcass is one of my Thanksgiving traditions. This is a warm and filling soup perfect for matching with bread.

If you break down or debone the bird you can make the stock ahead of time so you can make this soup Thanksgivng night, or the day after. 

This makes two and a half quarts of soup, so either scale the recipie, or share with people you love.

## Ingredients

* One and one half cups of lentils (red, yellow, green)
* One half cup of barley
* One 14 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
* One 14 oz can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* One 14 oz can white beans, drained and rinsed
* One pound of cooked turkey, dark and white meat, diced into small cubes
* One medium onion, diced
* Two medium carrots, diced
* Two stalks cellery, chopped
* Two and one half quarts turkey or chicken stock
* Two tbsp olive oil
* One tbsp unsalted butter
* One half teaspoon thyme
* Salt, to taste
* Freshly ground black pepper

## Method

Add olive oil and butter to a soup pot and bring to medium high heat.

When the butter melts, add the onion, carrot, and cellery. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables soften.

Add lentils and barley. Mix to coat with oil and liquids from the vegetables. 

Add a teaspoon of salt, the thyme, and plenty of black pepper. 

Add the stock, the beans, and the turkey. 

Stir, turn up heat to high, bring to a vigourous simmer, turn heat to low, cover. 

Let cook, stirring occasionally, for 90 minutes, or the lentils dissolve into the broth.

Taste for seasoning, serve.
