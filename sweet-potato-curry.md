# Sweet potato curry

Sweet potatos work well with Thai curry paste. For a splash of color, add a small purple sweet potato, diced.

## Ingredients 

* One large sweet potato, quartered and cut into 1/4 inch slices
* One small red onion, diced fine
* 4oz of Thai yellow curry paste (for example one can of Maesri brand)
* 1 can coconut milk
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 1 lb of chicken, pork, or firm tofu cut into 1 inch cubes
* Juice from 1/2 lime

## Directions

Saute the onion with a couple tablespoons of cooking oil in a dutch oven or other heavy bottomed, deep pot over medium heat until starting to brown. 

Add the curry paste and stir fry it for a minute.

Add your protein and stir to coat with the curry paste.

Add the sweet potatoes.

Add the coconut milk, sugar, and fish sauce, along with water or beer to cover.

Bring to simmer over high heat, turn to low, cover and cook at least 30 minutes or until potatoes are fork tender and the protein is cooked through. 

Add the lime juice, stir, and serve with jasmine rice, lime wedges, and sliced hot chilies (serrano or bird peppers.)
