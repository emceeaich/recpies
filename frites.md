# Frites (Fries)

## Notes

Frying the potatoes twice lets you get a tender inside, and a crispy outside. 

_Everyone (who wants) should try fries cooked in duck fat at least once._ 

## Ingredients

* Cooking oil (canola, or peanut) or fat (such as duck fat,) enough to cover a skillet or frying pan to 1"
* Three medium russet potatoes
* Kosher salt
* Mayonaise for dipping

## Directions

Clean and peel the the potatoes, optionally leaving the skin on each end. 

Slice the potatoes into 1/4" sticks along the long axis, and put in a bowl filled with clean, cool water. When the water becomes cloudy, change it. 

Add your oil or fat to the skillet (cast iron is recommended) and heat to 250 F as measured with a cooking thermometer.

Working in batches, only adding enough to cover the bottom of the skillet, fry the potatoes for 5 minutes. The oil should be bubbling vigourously. Keep checking the temperature. 

As each batch is done, remove from the fat, and put on paper towels. 

Once all batches have been cooked, raise the temperature of the oil to 350 F. 

Working in batches again, add the potatoes back to the hot oil and fry for another five minutes or until golden brown. 

Remove each batch to drain on paper towels. 

Sprinkle with salt, serve with mayonaise (because ketchup is barbaric.)

## Comments

The double frying technique comes from Chef John of Food Wishes.

If you don't want mayo with your fries, sprinkle them with sumac, and make a yogurt and harissa dipping sauce for them.

These fries are the perfect side for steak with a red wine and butter pan sauce, or steak poivre.
